3D-Printed Shell:: Visible in the clone pack imagery; screw bosses strip quickly and connector windows flex, motivating a reinforced replacement.
BMS (Battery Management System):: Protection circuitry (OV/UV/current/short) placed at the cell level. Candidates include DW01A+FS8205A dual MOSFET protection.
Buck Converter:: DC-DC stage that steps LiPo 3.7V down to 2.0V output. SOT-23-6 IC with 2.2µH inductor, feedback resistor sets output voltage.
OVP (Overvoltage Protection):: Zener diode or TVS clamp (<3V) that protects deck if buck converter fails, preventing raw cell voltage damage.
Embossed Gauge Block:: `openscad/pb3-pack.scad` solid used for quick printer fit checks; surface text "v0.1" tells which measurement set was used.
FR-4:: 0.8 mm fiberglass substrate specified for the new PCB to maximize internal volume.
Fuse + Ballast Resistor:: Components spotted on the tiny OEM PCB island in `IMG_9378.jpeg` and the Stereo2Go teardown close-ups; part of the host charge path and safety stack.
HS-PC202MII:: Primary test deck for this project. Its wall wart is missing and the factory PB-3 it shipped with is dead, so every new pack revision must satisfy this unit first.
KiCad V0.1 Project:: `kicad/pb3-replacement.kicad_pro` plus its schematic/PCB files. Holds the living electrical design that mirrors the mechanical gauges.
LiPo (Lithium Polymer):: Replacement chemistry: 3.7V nominal, 500mAh in 52×15×6mm cavity. Buck converter steps down to 2.0V output matching original PB-3 spec.
LiPo (Lithium Polymer):: Chemistry used in the Chinese clone packs (≈500 mAh). Images show a flat pouch bonded to the PCB and hard-wired to converter pins.
LiPo Pouch Cell:: Flat cell glued into the clone case (≈52 mm × 15 mm × 6 mm) shown in `IMG_9381.jpeg`, setting the maximum cavity volume for any chemistry.
NMC / NCA:: Common Li-ion chemistries considered for alternate designs; both require strict CC/CV charging.
NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient thermistor):: Sensor lead that original decks read for pack temperature; must be preserved in the new build.
PB-3 Blade Connector:: Two-pin keyed output interface molded into the pack nose; measurements come from caliper photos and the Stereo2Go gallery.
PB-3:: Original Aiwa sealed lead-acid (SLA) pack that powered slim cassette decks such as the HS-PC202MII. All dimensions referenced here derive from `measurements/IMG_9373.jpeg`–`IMG_9385.jpeg` and the Stereo2Go teardown thread archived under `research/`.
PB-4 / PB-4S:: Later PB-series packs that add top contact pads; our design keeps those pads alive for backward compatibility.
PB-4 Top Pads:: Additional contacts visible in the forum photos that allow PB-4 compatibility; our PCB footprint keeps them plated.
PB-S5:: Thin Aiwa pack that shares the modern USB-C clone PCB shown in the Stereo2Go photos; feedback resistor swaps change the regulated voltage.
SLA (Sealed Lead Acid):: Chemistry used in the factory PB-3. Nominal 2 V per cell, soft voltage sag that Walkman decks were tuned for.
