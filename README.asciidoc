:sectnumlevels: 5

We rebuild the PB-3 pack because Aiwa is gone and the cassette decks still run. The work lives here: schematics, notes, source images, and anything else needed to spin boards without guesswork.

== Repository contents

- `pb3-notes.adoc` — reverse engineering notebook.
- `images/*.puml` — PlantUML block diagrams.
- `research/` — frozen forum intel.
- `mechanical/*.scad` — OpenSCAD solids.
- `kicad/` — KiCad project + `kibot.yaml` config.
- `.github/workflows/cad-build.yml` — CI: renders all CAD, commits to `docs/generated/`.

== Automation

Four parallel jobs: `openscad`, `plantuml`, `kicad` → `publish`. Only `publish` commits.
