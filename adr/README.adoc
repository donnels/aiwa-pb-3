== Philosophy

Hemingway::
Short sentences. No fluff. Say it once.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)::
Write once. Reference everywhere. No copy-paste.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)::
Simple beats clever. If you need comments, simplify.

NO MAGIC::
Explicit over implicit. No hidden behavior. No surprises.

== What

ADRs document *why* we chose this over that.

Each record:

* States the decision
* Lists alternatives considered
* Explains consequences

== Why

Memory fades. Context dies. ADRs preserve intent.

When someone asks "why this way?", point to the ADR.
