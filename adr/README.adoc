= Architecture Decision Records
:toc:

== What

ADRs document *why* we chose this over that.

Each record:

* States the decision
* Lists alternatives considered
* Explains consequences

== Why

Memory fades. Context dies. ADRs preserve intent.

When someone asks "why this way?", point to the ADR.

== Format

```

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

== Context
Problem statement. One paragraph.

== Decision
What we chose. One sentence.

== Alternatives
- Option A: why rejected
- Option B: why rejected

== Implications

+ Good consequence
- Bad consequence
- Mitigation for bad consequence
```
