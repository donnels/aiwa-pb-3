= LED Blinker - KiCad Hello World
Sean Donnellan
:description: Minimal LED circuit for CI/CD pipeline testing

Purpose-built hello world project. Generated for testing KiBot automation and learning KiCad basics.

== Circuit

* +3V3 power rail
* 220Ω current-limiting resistor (R1)
* Red LED (D1)
* GND return

Current: (3.3V - 2.0V) / 220Ω ≈ 6mA

== Getting Started (Noobs/me)

=== Install KiCad on Steam Deck

[source,bash]
----
flatpak install flathub org.kicad.KiCad
----

Launch: Application Menu → Science&Math → KiCad

=== Opening This Project

1. Launch KiCad
2. File → Open Project
3. Navigate to: `~/Documents/Github/donnels/aiwa-pb-3/kicad-hello-world/`
4. Select: `led-blinker.kicad_pro`

=== What to Look Out For

.Steam Deck quirks (what I'm testing this on):
* Small screen
** Use `Ctrl +` / `Ctrl -` to zoom schematic/PCB
** OR use external monitor
* Save often
** KiCad doesn't auto-save. `Ctrl+S` is your friend.
* File paths
** Flatpak sandboxes to `~/Documents`. Keep projects there.
* Performance
** PCB editor sluggish? Close other apps. Deck has 16GB RAM but KiCad uses chunks.

.Quick tips:
* Schematic
** Press `A` to add component, `W` to wire, `M` to move
* PCB
** Press `X` to route track, `V` to add via, `D` to drag
* Hotkeys
** Tools → Edit Hotkeys - memorize these or you'll hate life
